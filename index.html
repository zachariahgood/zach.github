	</body> I like to watch sports, play videos games, and be lazy because that relaxes me and makes me feel good. Also I like to go on short walks because I feel like that just puts me in a calm state, but the only bad part is we don’t take care of the earth and all I see is rubbishy when I walk. I don’t really do a lot of things because I’m a lazy and boring person buts it’s fun to do stuff sometimes. Peace
